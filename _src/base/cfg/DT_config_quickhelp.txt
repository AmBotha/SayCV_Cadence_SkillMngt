DesignTools Configurator - QuickHelp

The Configurator allows you to tell the DesignTools programs
two important things:

  1.) Where to find SITE Level configuration files
      The SITE Level configuration files contain the settings
      dictated by your company policy and are maintained by
      your CAD manager.

  2.) Contact Information
      The contact information you provide is used in the
      generation of reports and the packaging of deliverables.


Known Issues:

There are a few bugs in the Cadence SKILL function that allows
you to select directories. You'll mainly see these bugs if you
are running a Microsoft Windows operating system. If you have
READ but not WRITE access to a directory (containing site 
level configuration files), the Cadence SKILL directory 
browser will not let you select that directory.

The solution to this problem is to simply type in the path to 
your SITE directoy in the provided box. What you type will be
validated to make sure it is a directory and that you have 
read access to it. You do not need write access to the SITE 
level configuration files to use them. You will only need 
write access to the SITE level configuration files if you're 
the company CAD Manager and want to modify the configuration
of your site.
