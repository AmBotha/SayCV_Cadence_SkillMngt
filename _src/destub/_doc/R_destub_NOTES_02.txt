The logic of mot_find_stubs.il is as follows:

I.)     Get List Of All Nets

II.)    Get A Single Net From The List Of Nets

III.)   Get List Of All Branches In The Net

IV.)    Get A Single Net Branch From The List of Net Branches

V.)     Get All Children Of The Net Branch 
          NOTE: "Children" are the Paths (clines), Pins, Vias, 
          Shapes and such that comprise the branch.
        
VI.)    If a child is not a Path (cline) it is marked as a "Sibling"

VII.)   If a Path (line/cline) starts at a "sibling" and ends at a 
        sibling, the path (cline) is *not* a stub.

Since a via is a type of "sibling" the logic above will fail miserably for our purposes.
