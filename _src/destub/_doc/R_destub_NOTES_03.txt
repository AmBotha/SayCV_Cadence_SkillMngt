From original email to you regarding this code:
> He is working on nets not pins and going from start of the net (e.g. trace     
> starting pin) and working to end of net (trace ending pin). In other words it's
> only checking for a stub on the starting pin but not the ending. If you used   
> this thing to count the stubs your numbers may be _WAY_ off.                   


For the sake of simplicity, asume a two layer (top and bottom) design, without 
shapes or other fancy stuff.

  X  1st Pad of net
  Z  last pad of net
  -  Trace
  |  Via



Trace (Stub):
  X----


Trace, Via (Antenna)
  X-----|
        |


Trace, Via, Trace (Stub)
  X-----|
        |-----


Gee, we got it right.
  X-----|
        |-----Z

Now here is a problem condition that this code can not handle:

   -----|
        |-----Z

The reason is the code does not work backwards from the "end" of the net.

Below is a second problem condition that we can not handle:

        |
        |-----Z

The reason is the same as above.
