<center><h1>My Appologies</h1></center>
<p>I'm sorry but I am yet to find the time needed to write the program that parses the all the sources and produces the &quot;Local&quot; HTML documentation needed for inclusion with the software (so you don't need an internet connection to get help). This is on my todo list but there are tons of other things that also need doing.</p>

<p>Until I get get a chance to write such a program, please use the online documentation at the project website. You can find application specific documentation under the &quot;Programs&quot; menu item on the project website.<p><br />
