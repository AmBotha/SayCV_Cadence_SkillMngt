DesignTools Rotator - QuickHelp

The goal of the Rotator program is to do bulk
rotation of text objects in your design. You get to
chose what rotations you want changed based on
degrees of rotation and the layer (class/subclass)
where the text is written.

A "Rotation Group" is a combination of a current
degrees of rotation value of text objects and a new
value to which it will be changed. You have three
such groups available so you can make three
different changes all at once.

If you wanted to set the rotation of all text to
zero (0) degrees, and the board has text rotated
at 90, 180 and 270, you'd set up your groups as
follows:

    Rotation Group #1
    If Rotation Is: 90
    Then Change To: 0

    Rotation Group #2
    If Rotation Is: 180
    Then Change To: 0

    Rotation Group #3
    If Rotation Is: 270
    Then Change To: 0

The "Default Settings" contain the "usual" class
and subclass layers you would normally want to have
changed. You can unselect the default layers on the
"Settings" tab.

If you want to rotate text on some class/subclass
that is not in the defaults, you'll need to
uncheck the "Use Default Subclasses" checkbox and
manually select the class and subclass you want.
You can select multiple subclasses by holding down
the control/shift keys.
